	<h1> Welcome to the only game that pays real money!</h1>
	<p> Are you tired of games that make fake promises like these? Are you looking for a game that delivers on that promise? Then we've got what you're looking for, but it won't be easy. In this game Quests are created by your fellow players to accomplish real world goals that they will pay Real World money for. One adventurer might offer a basic Fetch Quest to bring her a Sandwich. While another may need you to show up at a factory at 7AM and run a Transfer Press for eight hours. The one thing all these quests have in common, is that you can use the rewards to buy Real World products or turn your CashQuest Gold into Cash Money!</p>
