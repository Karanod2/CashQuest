<p>The map above this shows avaliable quests in your area. This section shows some important details about the selected quest. Including Total pay, $ per Mile, scheduled start, quest title, and a link to the full details page. Some quest types (food delivery) will have the "quest accept" button right here, while more involved quests (like a factory job) will only have the option to apply in the details screen. Clicking this allows the Hero to message with the QuestCreator, and assuming the two like eachother the QuestCreator can officially accept the application.</p>
