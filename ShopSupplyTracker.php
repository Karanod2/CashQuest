<h1>Supply Tracker</h1>
This area will be for the shop to quickly and easily reorder supplies. As we infiltrate the national supply chain this panel will get stronger every day. Eventually the user will be able to just click "resupply" and the system will create a Quest to deliver whatever the shop is short on.;
